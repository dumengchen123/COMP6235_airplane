This project revolves around modeling and forecasting flight delays for airlines. 

Data is collected from Miami Airport and Miami weather sources, encompassing weather information and flight data for the entire year of 2023.

A training dataset is constructed with a specific data building criterion: if an airline exceeds 50 flights on a given day, it is labeled as a negative sample; otherwise, it is considered a positive sample. 

This approach forms the basis of creating a supervised learning dataset. The dataset includes features such as Maximum, Minimum, Average, Departure, and Precipitation, in addition to a label.

We employ machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and LightGBM, for training and prediction.
